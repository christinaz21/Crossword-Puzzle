Our project implements a regulation 15x15 crossword as can be found in the New York Times. Players maneuver using mouse
clicks and key presses in order to fill out the puzzle according to the clues read in from Standard Input. Features within
the program include highlighting the selected square and those within the same row/col depending on the direction of player
input, as well as a button allowing the player to check their work.
